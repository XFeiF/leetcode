# What You Should Ask yourself?  

* What's the motivation behind the problem?  
* How could you use it to solve real-world problems?   
* What are the insights, the clever observations made on the problem's constraints that make the solution possible?   
* What details of the problem does the solution take advantage of to get that extra performance gain / space saving?   
* Where does the algorithm / data-structure / solution suck?   
* How could you make it better?   
* What do you lose and gain by doing so?   
* For the specific problem at hand, which solution presents the most acceptable trade-offs?
